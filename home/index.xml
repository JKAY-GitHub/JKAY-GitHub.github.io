      <description>I lead the multi-disciplinary Human Centred Technology Research Cluster at the University of Sydney, Australia.
My research is in the areas of Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED), Ubiquitous Computing (Ubicomp) and Human Computer Interaction (HCI). A core driver has been to create systems that enable people to harness their personal data for lifelong and life-wide learning. My research creates systems and interfaces for user models that people can scrutinise, to really see, understand and control their personal data and its use.</description>

My current projects are:
 Scrutable user modelling. This has been a core focus of my research. Key publications:
 1994: UMUAI paper on accretion/resolution architecture: Kay, Judy. &amp;ldquo;The um toolkit for cooperative user modelling.&amp;rdquo; User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction 4, no. 3 (1994): 149-196. | pdf
 1998: Thesis - my first use of term &amp;ldquo;scrutable&amp;rdquo;: A scrutable user modelling shell for user- adapted interaction.</description>
