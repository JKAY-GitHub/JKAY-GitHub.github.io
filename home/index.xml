      <description>I lead the multi-disciplinary Human Centred Technology Research Cluster at the University of Sydney, Australia.
My research is in the areas of Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED), Ubiquitous Computing (Ubicomp) and Human Computer Interaction (HCI). A core focus of my work has been to create system that enable people to harness their personal data for lifelong and lide-wide learning. This means creating systems and interfaces that for user models so thay people can scrutinize their model and its use.</description>
