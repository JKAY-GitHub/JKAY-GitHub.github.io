      <description>I lead the multi-disciplinary Human Centred Technology Research Cluster at the University of Sydney, Australia.
My research is in the areas of Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED), Ubiquitous Computing (Ubicomp) and Human Computer Interaction (HCI). A core driver has been to create systems that enable people to harness their personal data for lifelong and life-wide learning. My research creates systems and interfaces for user models that people can scrutinise, to really see, understand and control their personal data and its use.</description>

      <description>Scrutable user modelling to enable people to be in control of their personal data and its use. Key publications:
 1998: My thesis and first use of term &amp;ldquo;scrutable&amp;rdquo;, A scrutable user modelling shell for user-adapted interaction. I chose scrutable to reflect the effort people need to invest &amp;ndash; this contrasts with the common term transparent. Scrutable is human-centred, describing what people do, &amp;ndash; by contrast, eXplainable AI is what machine does.</description>
